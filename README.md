# face-tracking-using-arduino-processing
The processing sketch uses video &amp; openCV library of processing. The Arduino sketch is incomplete and will further use the servo library of arduino. Basically the X and Y position of the face is sent over the serial monitor to the arduino, which then maps the X co-ordinates in reverse because the camera inverts the image horizontally. This X Y values are used as the angle of the servo motor.
